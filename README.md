##Who Are We?

Main Street Mission is food pantry in China Grove, North Carolina, USA. The mission provides food and other donated items to
members of the community in need. This project aims to create an inventory and volunteer tracking system for use in food pantries and
food banks. There are not any good options for software for the small non-profits that run these pantries. This project will create a 
software system tailored to the needs of Main Street Mission and other food pantries.

##Why Should You Help?

The mission provides food for about 250 families each month. About 200 children are given school supplies each August. The mission also
provides meals for families on holidays. This is only one food pantry in the US. In [2010 5.6 million households](http://feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/hunger-facts/hunger-and-poverty-statistics.aspx)
accessed emergency food at a pantry in the US. Contributing to this project gives you an opportunity to help this organization and the people
